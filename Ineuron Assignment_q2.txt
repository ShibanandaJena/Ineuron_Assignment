Demonstrate use of abstract class, multiple inheritance and decorator in python using examples.


1. Abstract Class:


* A class that consists of one or more abstract method is called the abstract class. 


*  Abstract class can be inherited by the subclass and abstract method gets its definition in the subclass. 


* Python provides the abc module to use the abstraction in the Python program. 


2. Multiple Inheritance:


* Multi-Level inheritance is possible in python like other object-oriented languages.
 
* Multi-level inheritance is archived when a derived class inherits another derived class.
 
* There is no limit on the number of levels up to which, the multi-level inheritance is archived in python.


3. Decorators:


* Decorators are one of the most helpful and powerful tools of Python. 


* These are used to modify the behavior of the function. 


* Decorators provide the flexibility to wrap another function to expand the working of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
